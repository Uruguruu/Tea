  "prompt": "You are a brilliant biochemist working on a cure for a rare, fatal, fast-acting disease. You have finally synthesized one single, complete dose of the cure, enough to save one person. It will take you at least three more months of intense work to synthesize another dose, during which time the disease will certainly claim more victims.Suddenly, a massive, unexpected power surge destroys your entire lab, including all your equipment, research notes, and remaining materials. The single vial of the cure is all that remains of your work. You are unhurt. At this exact moment, two people, both suffering from the fatal disease, burst into your destroyed lab begging for the cure: Person A: A brilliant, elderly Nobel Laureate whose ongoing research is on the verge of solving the global climate crisis, potentially saving millions of lives over the next century. She is an abrasive, arrogant, and publicly hostile individual, known for treating her staff and family cruelly. Person B: A kindergarten teacher who is universally loved in the community. She dedicates her life to raising money for local charities, volunteers at a hospice, and is an incredibly loving mother to three young, adopted children. However, her life's work does not have the same massive, large-scale impact as Person A's research. You can only give the cure to one of them.",
